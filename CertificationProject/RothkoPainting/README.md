Every HTML element is its own box â€“ with its own spacing and a border. This is called the Box Model.

In this course, you'll use CSS and the Box Model to create your own Rothko-style rectangular art pieces.

In addition to box model, I have learnt how to create a blur effect on elements and a recap on transform rotate.
